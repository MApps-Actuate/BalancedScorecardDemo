BalancedScorecardDemo
=====================
The BalancedScorecardDemo is a project to be used as a starting point for constructing other Scorecard demos. It would be used by BIRT Engineers to help jumpstart their own custom demo. Customer data can be loaded into this base demo to provide a custom-tailored experience for prospects. 

The BalancedScorecard.datadesign is setup to combine the most commonly used fields within Scorecard.  Edit the datasource to point it to the approprite iHub Server Profile, and you will instantly see the views etc from scorecard database associated with the iHub profile.
